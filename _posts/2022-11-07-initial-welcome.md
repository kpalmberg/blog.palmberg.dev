Hey there! Or should I say...hello world? Welcome to the first post on my blog, Palmberg's Zone, where I plan to write about cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity, programming, and technology. I'm Kevin Palmberg, a Senior Cloud Infrastructure Engineer who plans to write about emerging developments in the industry, tutorials/how-to guides, educational articles, and anything I'm passionate about in technology. For myself, this blog will be an opportunity to write about emerging technology and deeply technical topics to continuously advance my own knowledge and along the way I can share that knowledge with you.

I'm looking forward to posting the first *real* articles on the site very soon. Thanks for stopping by!
