# About

A personal blog where I discuss cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity, programming, and technology. Access the site live at https://blog.palmberg.dev.

# Building locally

1. Install prerequisites for Jekyll development as [detailed by GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll#prerequisites). Windows is also not an officially supported platform as described in the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/), so I've opted to develop for this project on Linux.
2. Run `bundle` to install all of the dependencies from the project root directory.
3. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to run the site locally from the project root directory. Then access the site at `http://127.0.0.1:4000`.
